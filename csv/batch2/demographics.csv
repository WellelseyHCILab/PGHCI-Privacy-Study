The study ran smoothly without errors and interruptions. I found the information presented in this study to be very attention grabbing and concrete. The study was concise and presented clearly. This study has made me very interesting in learning more about where my ancestors came from and my health history. I would be very interesting in a study like this, because I do come from a family with a family history of cancers, blood pressure, and etc. ","1246"

I tried my best, so hopefully you aren't rejecting if I got a couple wrong.  I didn't really get what &quot;genealogical features&quot; meant.  I assumed that was related to ancestry and identifying mine with the use of the information.  And what information could be used?  I don't recall it saying any of that information would be used.  Things like that.  Other than that, it was pretty easy and painless and paid well enough that I tried to do a reasonable job on it.","103"
