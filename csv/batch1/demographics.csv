The study ran smoothly without errors and interruptions. I found the information presented in this study to be very attention grabbing and concrete. The study was concise and presented clearly. This study has made me very interesting in learning more about where my ancestors came from and my health history. I would be very interesting in a study like this, because I do come from a family with a family history of cancers, blood pressure, and etc. ","1246"

Though I worry about what conditions I may have, I found myself more concerned with how this information could help others and genetic research in the future.","207"

I'm not great at absorbing complex material especially material that I have absolutely no interest in (like privacy forms and legality type forms that were presented here.) I don't know that I'm unique in that respect or if that is commonplace with a lot of people, I just know I've always been that way and have to read them several times to truly understand it (that's why I almost never do it.) But I was able to find most of the answers to the questions on the last page (except for the 2 I mentioned) and there was 1 question on the first page I was a little unsure of. Thank you.","345"
