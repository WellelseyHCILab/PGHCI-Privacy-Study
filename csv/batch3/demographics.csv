The study ran smoothly without errors and interruptions. I found the information presented in this study to be very attention grabbing and concrete. The study was concise and presented clearly. This study has made me very interesting in learning more about where my ancestors came from and my health history. I would be very interesting in a study like this, because I do come from a family with a family history of cancers, blood pressure, and etc. ","1246"

I've done over 16,000 HITs on Mturk and I found this one to definitely be in the top 10 of the more enjoyable hits I've done. I found the topic to be quite interesting and the study was set up in a way that it was easy to understand and complete. There were some tough questions but they never left me feeling frustrated. All in all, a very awesome study.","189"

"208","765e","male","30","bachelor degree","no","yes","english","interesting study. We are entering a brave new world of horrors.  Near the end of Darkness at Noon, there is some dialogue about the the fate of humanity being a boot stomping down on the collective necks of humans for eternity. That is where we are heading. Genetics will provide the basis for mass discrimination, for relegation to second class citizenship. We are already creating biological agents that focus on specific populations. The brown ones predominately. Genetic research has the power to elevate humans by curing disease and extending our lives, but we rank and file drones will not see that aspect of it. Instead, it will be used for oppression and debasement. Humans are sick, twisted, sub-bestial beings. Our civilization has made us all at least slightly batty and neurotic. As Roger Waters says, &quot;give any one species too much rope and they'll fuck it up.&quot; The worst thing that ever happened to humans was self-awareness. It has all been down hill since then.","612"

Recently, my husband and I purchased a DNA kit to identify the breed and or breeds or a dog we adopted from a shelter. We just swabbed the inside of his cheek with two Q-tip like swabs and send it through the mail to the lab. It turns out the shelter was totally wrong about his breed. Thanks to the DNA kit we were able to understand why some of his traits existed. When my finances improve, I will definitely be looking into doing some genetic testing for myself and my husband in the future.","412"
